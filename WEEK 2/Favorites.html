<h2 class="Section-header">Favorite Movie</h2>
<p>
    The name of one of my favorite movie is <span id="Favorite-Movie-Title"><i> TITANIC </i></span> , it does have a very sad ending but a very beautiful story line and how its based <BR>
    on a true story makes it even better, it is indeed heartbreaking that so many people lost their lives but the fact <BR>
    that a movie that was made in memory makes that much more of an impact and a difference.
